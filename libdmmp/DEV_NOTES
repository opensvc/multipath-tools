== Planned features ==
 * Expose all properties used by /usr/bin/multipath

== Code style ==
 * Keep things as simple as possible.
 * Linux Kernel code style.
 * Don't use typedef.
 * Don't use enum.
 * We are not smarter than API user, so don't create wrapping function like:

    ```
    dmmp_mpath_search_by_id(struct dmmp_context *ctx,
                            struct dmmp_mpath **dmmp_mp,
                            uint32_t dmmp_mp_count, const char *id)

    dmmp_path_group_id_search(struct dmmp_mpath *dmmp_mp,
                              const char *blk_name)
    ```
 * The performance is the same for query single mpath and query all mpaths,
   so no `dmmp_mpath_of_wwid(struct dmmp_context *ctx, const char *wwid)` yet.

== Naming scheme ==
 * Public constants should be named as `DMMP_XXX_YYY`.
 * Public functions should be named as `dmmp_<noun>_<verb>`.
 * Private constants should be named as `_DMMP_XXX_YYY`.
 * Private functions should be named as `_dmmp_<noun>_<verb>`.

== Code Layout ==
 * libdmmp_private.h
    Internal functions or macros.
 * libdmmp.c
    Handling multipathd IPC and generate dmmp_context and
    dmmp_mpath_array_get().
 * libdmmp_mp.c
    For `struct dmmp_mpath`
 * libdmmp_pg.c
    For `struct dmmp_path_group`
 * libdmmp_path.c
    For `struct dmmp_path`
 * libdmmp_misc.c
    Misc functions.

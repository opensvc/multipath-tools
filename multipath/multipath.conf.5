can be processed. This will result in errors like
"timeout receiving packet" to be returned from CLI commands.
In these cases it is recommended to increase the CLI timeout to avoid
those issues.

.SH "WWID generation"
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.
Multipath uses a \fIWorld Wide Identification\fR (WWID) to determine
which paths belong to the same device. Each path presenting the same
WWID is assumed to point to the same device.
.LP
The WWID is generated by three methods (in the order of preference):
.TP 17
.B getuid_callout
Use the specified external program; cf \fIgetuid_callout\fR above.
Care should be taken when using this method; the external program
needs to be loaded from disk for execution, which might lead to
deadlock situations in an all-paths-down scenario.
.TP
.B uid_attribute
Use the value of the specified udev attribute; cf \fIuid_attribute\fR
above. This method is preferred to \fIgetuid_callout\fR as multipath
does not need to call any external programs here. However, under
certain circumstances udev might not be able to generate the requested
variable.
.TP
.B vpd_pg83
If none of the \fIgetuid_callout\fR or \fIuid_attribute\fR parameters
are present multipath will try to use the sysfs attribute
\fIvpd_pg83\fR to generate the WWID.
.
.
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH "KNOWN ISSUES"
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.
The usage of \fIqueue_if_no_path\fR option can lead to \fID state\fR
processes being hung and not killable in situations where all the paths to the
LUN go offline. It is advisable to use the \fIno_path_retry\fR option instead.
.P
The use of \fIqueue_if_no_path\fR or \fIno_path_retry\fR might lead to a
deadlock if the \fIdev_loss_tmo\fR setting results in a device being removed
while I/O is still queued. The multipath daemon will update the \fIdev_loss_tmo\fR
setting accordingly to avoid this deadlock. Hence if both values are
specified the order of precedence is \fIno_path_retry, queue_if_no_path, dev_loss_tmo\fR.
